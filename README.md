# House Price Prediction

## Task Objective
To predict house prices based on property characteristics using regression techniques and evaluate model performance using error metrics.

## Dataset Used
House Price Prediction Dataset (Kaggle), containing features such as:
- Area
- Bedrooms
- Location
- Price (target variable)

## Models Applied
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## Key Results and Findings
- The model achieved an MAE of approximately 246,000 and an RMSE of approximately 286,000.
- Predictions are concentrated in a narrow range, indicating underfitting.
- Including more features (e.g., bathrooms, condition, year built) and further tuning could significantly improve accuracy.
